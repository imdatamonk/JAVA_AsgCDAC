Can continue with earlier Point2D class
Create a Point class Point2D , under package com.app.geometry  : for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

1.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

1.2 Add public String show()) --to return point's x & y co-ords

1.3 Add isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must ret. true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise. : 


1.4 Add calculateDistance method to calculate distance between current point n  specified point & return the distance to the caller.
(eg double  calcDistance(Point2D p2))
Hint : Use distance formula . Use java.lang.Math class methods --sqrt, pow etc.

1.5 Write TestPoint class , under "tester" package with a main method
Accept co ordinates of 2 points from user (Scanner) --p1 & p2

1.6 Use show method to display point details.(p1's details & p2's details)

1.7 Invoke isEqual & display if points are same or different (i.e p1 & p2 are located at the same position)

1.8 Display distance between 2 points.(between p1 & p2)
