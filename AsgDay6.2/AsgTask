3. Solve this
Create a class Vehicle , under the package : com.app.vehicles , to represent any vehicle. 
state  : registrationNo : int , color : String , price : double
registrationNo  MUST be unique (non duplicate) for any vehicle
Override toString

Create a class TestVehicle under the package "tester"
Create an array to store vehicle details
Business Rule : If user enters duplicate registrationNo  : give error message & do not that vehicle details in the array.
After filling up the array , display all vehicle details(Use : toString)

How will you check the equality ? 

You can add your own method "isEqual" in the Vehicle class n test it.

BUT why not use Object class method & override it suitably ?

Hint : Use Object class method

public boolean equals(Object o)

(Do it with lab faculty's help)
